1. Basil Pesto Stuffed Mushrooms
20 crimini mushrooms, washed and stems removed; 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs; 1/4 cup melted butter; 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley; 2 cups fresh basil leaves; 1/4 cup fresh Parmesan cheese; 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 1 tablespoon fresh garlic; 2 teaspoons lemon juice; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
Heat the oven to 350 F. Line the mushroom caps upside down on a baking sheet. To prepare the topping, in a small bowl, combine the panko, butter and parsley; set aside. To prepare the filling, place the basil, cheese, pumpkin seeds, oil, garlic, lemon juice and salt in a food processor. Process until evenly mixed. Generously stuff the mushroom caps with the basil pesto filling. Sprinkle each mushroom with about 1 teaspoon of panko topping. Gently pat down the topping. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

2. Shrimp Ceviche
1/2 pound raw shrimp, cut in 1/4-inch pieces; 2 lemons, zest and juice; 2 limes, zest and juice; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 2 teaspoons cumin; 1/2 cup diced red onion; 1 cup diced tomato; 2 tablespoons minced garlic; 1 cup black beans, cooked; 1/4 cup diced serrano chili pepper and seeds removed; 1 cup diced cucumber, peeled and seeded; 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
Place shrimp in a shallow pan and cover with juice from the lemon and lime, reserving the zest. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or until shrimp is firm and white. Mix remaining ingredients in separate bowl and set aside while shrimp is cold cooking. When ready to serve, mix shrimp and citrus juice with remaining ingredients. Serve with baked tortilla chips.
